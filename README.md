# Fetch-Render-Project

## General Information
The purpose of this project is to pull and render images from an API.

## Improvements Made
I mainly worked on learning how to pull images form an API. I did not have time to properly use React hooks like useSate() and useEffect() but my plan is to use these the week we will have off from the program, so I will refactor and re-upload this code base. 

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript
- React
- Bootstrap
